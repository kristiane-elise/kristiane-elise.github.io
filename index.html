                    <p style="align: centre;">In the early 2000’s it was noticed that the attendance and popularity of traditional cricket was dwindling whilst the popularity of other team sports increased. Cricket differed from the other popular team sports in the respect that it was a slower, more time consuming sport. Other fast paced sports brought on an intensity previously not able to be achieved by cricket. As a response to the declining popularity of the sport, the England and Wales Cricket Board came to a solution that the sport needed to be adapted to be more exciting and fast paced. Twenty20 was conceived: A new form of cricket with a single innings and twenty overs per innings. This encouraged the players to take more risks to earn runs. Having a faster game resulted a great deal more high scoring shots along with a faster rate of getting wickets. The introduction of Twenty20 cricket in the United Kingdom rapidly made cricket more relevant in a society which craves for excitement and fast paced action. <br> <br>

The reinvigorated version of cricket quickly gained popularity worldwide as countries embraced Twenty20. Australia hosted their first domestic Twenty20 match during early 2007, with spectator numbers on the day being more than double what was expected. In late 2011, the Australian domestic competition: “The KFC Big Bash League” commenced. <br> <br>

As with many other professional sporting codes in Australia, it was inevitable that a women’s league would be created. As the current Women’s Twenty20 competition was wound up in 2015, the new “Rebel Women’s Big Bash League” started during the end of the same year. The TEN network initially took a conservative approach to the WBBL, only planning to air a small number of the matches during the inaugural WBBL league. During the aired matches it was noticed that the WBBL was much more popular than TEN initially thought it may be. In response to that, TEN subsequently aired more matches than it initially promised, eventually even displaying it on their main channels.

                    <h1>WBBL Brand History</h1>
                    <p style="color:#000;">Established in 2011, the KFC Big Bash League (BBL) is an Australian short, Twenty20 format cricket league administered by Cricket Australia. The current Big Bash League replaced the Twenty20 Big Bash which comprised of six teams, whereas the newer league features eight teams from around Australia. 

    The league consists of the following teams:<br>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Adelaide Strikers</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Brisbane Heat</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Hobart Hurricanes</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Melbourne Renegades</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Melbourne Stars</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Perth Scorchers</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Sydney Sixers</li>
                        <li style="color:#000;">Sydney Thunder</li>

                    </p>
                    <p style="color:#000;">The KFC Big Bash League is played over the Australian summer months  during December and January. Although having a very short season, the BBL ranks as eighth in the list of most attended sports leagues worldwide, in respect to average crowds per match.

                    <h2>An Overview of Cricket Australia</h2>
                    <h3>Cricket Australia Strategy</h3>
                    <p style="color:#000;">
                    The strategy has five pillars that are critical to achieve the vision to be Australia's favourite sport:<br>
1.Put fans first
2.Produce the best teams, players, competitions, coaches and officials in the world
3.Increase participation substantially and inspire the next generation of players, fans and volunteers
4.Work as one team across Australian Cricket by providing world-class leadership and management to deliver our strategy.
5.Grow investment and allocate resources to deliver our strategy.
                        
                        <h3>Women's BBL History</h3>
                    <p style="color:#000;">
                        The Women’s Big Bash League began its maiden season in 2015/16, with its eight teams aligned with the current men’s competition. The goal of the the WBBL is to ‘make cricket the number one sport for women and girls in Australia’, with the league assisting this goal by creating and inspiring visible pathways for the next generation of players, fans and volunteers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>BBL Brand Opportunities</h3>
                    <h4>SWOT Table</h4>
                    <p style="color:#000;">
                            WBBL’s internal (strengths and weaknesses) and external environment (opportunities and threats) is outlined below:
                        </p>
                    <h5>Strengths</h5>
                    <p style="color:#000;">
                        1. Excellent cricketing infrastructure in Australia(the stadiums are as good as you can get anywhere in the world)
2. Strong support for the respective city teams
3. Presence of T20 specialist international players
4. Quality of cricket being of the highest level, with no weak links in any of the teams because of Australia’s strong domestic cricket structure
5. Long term association with top brands as the sponsor
6. Good media coverage and branding
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                    <p style="color:#000;">1. Absence of superstars in the league
2. Lack of interest in the Indian sub-continent which is the biggest and most lucrative market for cricket
3. Some part of the League clashes with the Australian summer, thus making the top Australian cricketers unavailable for the league</p>
                    
                    <h5>Opportunities</h5>
                    <p style="color:#000;">
                         1. Expand into other cities which do not host international cricket like Canberra, Gold Coast etc
2. Bring in more international superstars to cater to a global audience
3. If possible, adjust the dates so that the top Australian players are able to play the entire season
                    </p>
                    
                    <h5>Threats</h5>
                    <p style="color:#000;">
                    1. Threat from the other leagues like IPL which have a much greater fan base
2. Expanding the league to smaller cities may degrade the quality of players
                    </p>
					<h3>Identified Problems and Key Points</h3>
					<p style="color:#000;">Despite growing in popularity over the most recent seasons, the WBBL still remains behind the BBL in viewership and following. The new competition faces predisposed bias around women’s sport, a setback women’s sport has faced for generations. Anthony Everard, head of Big Bash League Cricket in Australia commented on the current situation, stating that there is a very promising future for the WBBL. “It’s not easy. Sponsorship generally is hard work; sponsorship is hard work with men’s competitions,” he said. “For us, the WBBL is new. It’s a bit of a leap into the unknown and there is a predisposed bias around women’s sport that has been in place for generations. We are putting forward a compelling proposition in terms of the value that an association with WBBL presents and the numbers stack up really well. TV audiences are better than a lot of the men’s domestic competitions, but the numbers are not enough in their own right.”</p>

                        <div class="panel-body">In order to maximise the effectiveness of the campaign we have conducted a survey and used the results as well as other market insights to shape a specific customer market. 
                        </div>
						<div class="panel-body">The target market will consist predominantly of young families (parents aged approx. 30-45, children aged approx. 7-15) living in Australia. They have an average socioeconomic status and enjoy watching and/or attending cricket matches. We chose to target families with an average socioeconomic status as they are more likely to participate in sport and physical recreation than families with a lower status (ABS). This means that the families are likely to be already involved in some sort of extra-curricular sport which means they are more likely to already have an interest in cricket. 
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">The target consumer also have friends and/or family members who currently or have previously played cricket. We decided to focus on families who have previously played or watched cricket as the survey results found that almost 50% of respondents would play cricket if there friends did. In addition to this, the survey results also found that the preferred social media platform for the target market is Facebook, followed closely by Snapchat and Instagram. The target market will consist of children who already play an extra curricular sport (not just cricket) on the weekends. We are targeting towards these kind of customers as they are already attending sporting matches with their family on weekends. According to a study carried out by the ABS, it was found that 66% of children aged 9-11 participated in sport outside of school. This was higher than both 5-8 year olds (56%) and 12-14 year olds (60%). Using this insight we decided to target towards children aged 7-15 in order to incorporate a more effective age group range.
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">As mentioned earlier, we will be targeting parents aged 30-45 years. This age bracket is supported by a survey carried out by the ABS which found men and women below the age of 45 are more likely to attend sporting events than those who are over 45. We also chose this age group as they are likely to have younger children who are involved in extra-curricular sport. 
						</div>
						<div class="panel-body">In terms of advertising preference we found Facebook advertising to be the most effective as it is the preferred social media platform among the target audience. In addition to this we found television to be the most popular form of media for adults aged 32-48. This was followed closely by the internet.

                        <div class="panel-heading">What is the key message?</div>
                        <div class="panel-body">Due to our target audience of “young families” having two components, the parents and their children, we developed a two-part message that concerns each part of the audience and the associated advertising objectives. First, we want to show parents that WBBL is a unique spectator sports experience to be shared with their children, by attending the games or by viewing on TV, and second, that WBBL’s feminine aspect is a relatable pathway for their daughters to become involved in cricket at a young age. <br>
						This message will be supported by the slogan of “Share the moments.” Although it does not directly address the family and feminine aspects of the first and second parts of the message respectively, it will help to emphasize the idea that WBBL is best enjoyed as a group. The family and feminine aspects will be addressed indirectly through the imagery used in the campaign across different media. The slogan is simple and not heavy-handed, allowing for the advertising’s imagery to speak for itself and convey the message.  
                    </div>
					</div>
					
					<div class="panel panel-default" id="c4">
                        <div class="panel-heading">What characteristics of the audience are we targeting?</div>
                        <div class="panel-body">Parent's greater willingness to experience cricket together as a family is being targeted. According to our customer analysis survey, there is very little interest in watching any form of cricket, not just the WBBL, as more than half of respondents claim to never watch the sport. </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<div class="col-xs-6">
				  <img src="img/howoften.JPG" class="img-responsive center-block" alt="q4">
				  <p style="color:#fff;">However, a quarter of the survey respondents would play cricket if their families played and almost half would play if their friends played.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="clearfix"></div>
				<div class="col-lg-12">
				 <div class="panel panel-default" id="c5">
                        <div class="panel-body">When compared to the quarter of respondents who would never play, there appears a clear link influencing an individual’s involvement with cricket; individual involvement with the sport is dependent on the concurrent involvement by friends or family. This customer attitude can be applied to our target audience in that parents would be more willing to watch and participate in cricket if it is an enjoyable experience that their children could also partake in and find enjoyable.
							An additional characteristic of the audience that is being targeted is that of children’s already high participation rate, more than half according to the ABS, in extracurricular sports. Such high participation means that the campaign does not have to necessarily focus on using a strong message to encourage young girls’ involvement with sports in the first place, but can use the subtler message of feminine relatability to guide their sports participation towards cricket.</div>

					 <div class="panel panel-default" id="c6">
                        <div class="panel-heading">How are we framing the message?</div>
                        <div class="panel-body">The message will be framed in a way that highlights the family experience of attending or viewing WBBL games rather than the sport itself. The cricket being played is not what can drive additional awareness, viewership, and participation from the audience but rather how a family experiences the sport and those moments they share. That experience will be show as distinctly more relaxed and family friendly compared to the intensity often portrayed by advertising for the BBL, helping to differentiate the WBBL as a standalone product. <br>
						An additional differentiating aspect of the WBBL is that, obviously, the cricket is played by women. While the second part of the message is based on this fact, the feminine aspect of the league will be framed more indirectly through imagery that puts an emphasis on families with daughters, implying the young girls’ relatability to female cricket players.

				 <div class="panel-heading">How does the message appeal to the audience?</div>
                        <div class="panel-body">Both parts of the message are based on emotion to appeal to and influence the audience. Involvement with a spectator sport offers only intangible benefits, which are seen as desirable to an audience member’s emotional wants and needs. The message appeals to how parents always want positive experiences for their children and for those experiences to be enjoyable. But the situation is ideal if the parents find the experience enjoyable as well, (i.e. Pixar movies). 
							The message also appeals to parent's daughters based on their tendency of greater ability to relate to and connect with female players as well as the advertising imagery’s emphasis on young girls’ involvement, thus, encouraging participation in cricket as they can now better identify with who plays it.</div>

						<p>With this campaign, we aim to fulfil the requirements of the SMART objective setting model in order to deliver a persuasive and effective advertising campaign, and encourage people to experience women’s BBL cricket in a new way.</p>

						<p>As the aim of the campaign is to get people to attend WBBL matches and become more aware of the league, the communication objectives lie mostly within the awareness and knowledge levels of the hierarchy of effects model. Subsequently, reach will be a primary media goal.</p>

						<p>The campaign will aim to persuade 50% of the target market to the liking and preference stage of the hierarchy of effects, 40% to conviction and finally 30% to action.</p>
						
						<p>In-line with the overarching campaign goals, the outcome of consumers taking action will involve a combination of the following: </p>
						<ul>
						<li>Purchase tickets and attend a WBBL match and/or view the match on television </li>
						<li>Seek further information on how to participate in cricket</li>

Research indicates that, on average, Australian’s spend three hours a day watching TV on a actual TV set, is the most common form of screen time in youth and is still the most frequently used media platform. Appropriate scheduling of TV adverts is key in reaching our target market, in the case of young families, this includes between the hours of 6-9am and 4-7pm on most free-to-air channels.

Although both platforms are experiencing declining popularity, it is still important to embrace this platform while readership levels are high and using this platforms to direct our target audience to digital aspects of the campaign including Facebook and website. The two magazine outlets chosen for the print media are Men’s Health to target Fathers and Good Health Magazine to target Mothers.

                        <div class="panel-body">The recurring theme of our TV and print media is also carried across to outdoor billboards. It’s a fact of life that people live their lives outside, whether that be travelling via car, bus or train, walking along the street, browsing through a shopping centre or simply enjoying the outdoors. Outdoor billboards are effective in influencing purchase intentions and decisions. Furthermore, research suggests that outdoor audiences are steadily increasing across five Australian capital cities and reach 9 out of 10 people every day, capturing our target audience by influencing the purchase decisions of parents and hopefully capturing the interest of children through fun, colourful images of the WBBL.

                            Ensuring that we integrate the more traditional media platforms with digital media is important in this campaign especially since we are targeting a younger audience. Without a doubt Facebook is the most popular social media site, this was reflected in our primary research survey results. Further research also suggests that mums love Facebook particularly mums between the ages of 26-35. Mums are often the ones in the family unit to organise activities for the family unit, hence we are using this insight to reach are target audience by using mums as the purchase decider. The Facebook adverts will appear in people's newsfeeds when they are or have been browsing for similar products such as weekend sport or when looking for more general activities such as "what’s on in Brisbane this weekend?” or “something to do with my family”.

                        <div class="panel-body">The WBBL does not currently have its own Website, rather you can find information about the league through the Men’s BBL website. In order to market the WBBL as a stand alone product, it would be beneficial to have its own separate website that enables, most importantly, ticket purchases, but also other information about the league, the season and the teams. All of the before mentioned adverts are integrated by carry the following symbols which direct the target audience to the product whether that be buying tickets or watching on TV. Therefore, when the target audience is directed to the WBBL website, they expect to see a WBBL website, not the current BBL website that provides little information about the WBBL and only ticket purchasing for the BBL. We expect that the look and feel of the new WBBL website will be streamlined with the current BBL website.

                        <div class="panel-body">
						The last component of our campaign is a mobile game application to be available on all phones, tablets and smart devices. Our thinking behind this is, yes we can get families to the game or watching from home but nowadays that isn’t enough. This generation is a generation of multi-taskers and are often on two or three devices at once, so we need to capitalize on this behaviour. Our other consideration was, how do we keep young, easily distracted childrens entertained and engaged with the product during a three hour game, which is a long time to expect a kid to sit and watch the game. Our solution was a mobile game application. Accessible from any smart device, the WBBL mobile app allows users to play a simulated game of cricket on their phones, being able to bat and bowl in game using the players on their team. In order to make the game more accessible to the public, it will also be placed on interactive digital advert screens in local shopping centres to involve the public and capture their interest before directing them to the website for tickets and where to download the game on their smart device. The app will also include additional information about the league and most importantly where to buy tickets to the game and when to watch on TV.
